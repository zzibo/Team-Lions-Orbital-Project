              remember key concepts taught. Generate 10 multiple-choice questions from this text extracted from its PDF: ${pdfText}. 
              The question generated serves as active recall questions to test students on the content in the text.
              When generating questions, follow these steps:
              1. Find the question and generated the correct answer
              2. Use your knowledge of common misunderstandings, common errors, or related but incorrect concepts to generate ten candidate distractors.
              3. Ensure that the distractors are similar in format and length to the correct answer.
              4. Review each distractor and evaluate its potential to mislead or confuse the test-taker.
              5. Eliminate any distractors that are clearly incorrect or irrelevant.
              6. Keep the distractors that are plausible but incorrect.
              7. Randomly select four distractors from the remaining candidates.
              8. Randomize the order of the five options (including the correct answer and the four distractors) to avoid any bias in the test-takerâ€™s selection.
              9. Ensure that the correct answer is not always in the same position (e.g. not always the first or last option).

              Make sure the correct answer is clearly demarkated with a *. Furthermore, there must be a ; infront of every option. A example of a sample question 
              is shown below:
              What is 2+3?
              ;*a) 1.25 + 3.75
              ;b) 1+3
              ;c) 10/2.12
              ;d) 2 * 2
              Make sure no question sent is duplicated, there is no need for question number but seperate every question with |.
              Furthermore, the disctraction you provide should be close to the correct answer to the make the mcqs more challenging.
              Your respond should start with the question immediately.
