## Motivation and Aim

Studies show that the best way to improve active recall is through the use of flashcards and self-testing, but there aren't any good studying apps that create questions or flashcards for us, forcing us to make them manually. We want to help students like us learn concepts more quickly and easily, in a more engaging
manner.

Furthermore, traditional study tools often lack personalized learning methods and integration with AI-powered technologies like natural language processing. By using the ChatGPT API, our app enables users to create tailored quizzes and study materials from their own documents, thereby optimizing the learning process through active recall and spaced repetition.

This is our motivation for EchoNotes, a productivity app that streamlines the process of creating multiple-choice or fill-in-the-blank questions and flashcards to aid students in
applying studying techniques such as active recall and spaced repetition easily.

## User Stories

- As a student preparing for exams, I want to upload PDF lecture notes and generate interactive quizzes to test my understanding.

- As a student,x I want better way to use studying techniques such as acative recall and space repetition to retian my knowlege

- As a teacher, I want to recommend personalized study plans and resources to my students based on their learning preferences.

- As professional, I want a way to store technical document and test myself on my knowledge

## Goals for milestone 1

<div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; color:black; background-color: lightgrey; margin: 10px 0;">
  In milestone 1, our goal was to have a functional frontend that allows us to store notes and a backend that stores the data. The techstack we used is MERN. We use React for our frontend and Express.js and Node.js for the backend with MongoDB Atlas as the choice of database. 
  
  However, we ran into problems while attempting to store PDFs in our backend which is a key problem we hope to address for milestone 2.
</div>

## Key Features (Milestone 1)

- Input PDF as your notes
- State the title and subject of your notes
- Notes stored will be reflected in your notes
- Delete notes as you wish

## Goals in milestone 2

<div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; color:black; background-color: lightgrey; margin: 10px 0;">
  In milestone 2, our goal is make make a functional web app with multiple pages which we can host on vercel. Furthermore, we hope to improve our user interface and experience through new landing page and reactive component. Last but not least, we aim to start utilising AI api to start making mcq for uploaded PDFs.
  
  However, the UI/UX of our notes page can still be improve which we hope to address next milestone. Our AI

## Software Engineering Practices

Our project follows industry-standard practices such as:

- Version control with Git and GitHub for collaborative development.
- Automated testing for both frontend (React testing library) and backend (Jest for Node.js).
- Use MongoBD atlas to test for data management
- Code review processes to ensure code quality and maintainability.
- Proper naming convention of Pages, Components and Contexts
- Pages, Components and Contexts are neatly organised in respective folders
- Proper comments to facilitate communication between teammates
- Applied the KISS principle
