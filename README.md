## Motivation and Aim

EchoNotes aims to revolutionise the way students engage with study materials by harnessing the power of modern technology and cognitive learning techniques. Traditional methods of studying often involve laborious tasks like manually creating flashcards and quizzes, which can be time-consuming and less effective in promoting deep learning. Recognising this challenge, EchoNotes seeks to provide a seamless solution that enhances learning efficiency and engagement.

At its core, EchoNotes leverages active recall and spaced repetition, two scientifically proven methods that enhance memory retention and learning comprehension. Active recall involves actively retrieving information from memory, which is crucial for reinforcing knowledge and identifying gaps in understanding. Spaced repetition optimises this process by strategically spacing out review sessions over time, ensuring that information is retained in long-term memory.

One of the distinctive features of EchoNotes is its integration with AI-powered technologies, particularly the ChatGPT API. This integration allows users to generate personalised quizzes and study materials directly from their own documents. By analysing text and extracting key concepts, EchoNotes automates the creation of multiple-choice questions, fill-in-the-blank exercises, and flashcards. This not only saves time but also ensures that study materials are tailored to the user's specific needs and learning objectives.

In essence, EchoNotes aims to empower students by providing them with a user-friendly platform that facilitates active learning and knowledge retention. By combining advanced technology with proven educational strategies, EchoNotes transforms the study experience, making it more effective, efficient, and enjoyable for students striving to excel academically.

This is our motivation for EchoNotes, a productivity app that streamlines the process of creating multiple-choice or fill-in-the-blank questions and flashcards to aid students in applying studying techniques such as active recall and spaced repetition easily.

## Goals for milestone 1

<div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; color:black; background-color: lightgrey; margin: 10px 0;">
  In milestone 1, our goal was to have a functional frontend that allows us to store notes and a backend that stores the data. The techstack we used is MERN. We use React for our frontend and Express.js and Node.js for the backend with MongoDB Atlas as the choice of database. 
  
  However, during milestone 1, we encountered significant challenges when attempting to handle PDF uploads within our backend infrastructure. This issue became a critical obstacle that hindered our progress and necessitated a more focused approach for milestone 2.

The primary problem we faced revolved around effectively managing PDF files uploaded by users. Integrating PDF storage involves handling binary data efficiently, ensuring secure and reliable file uploads, and managing the associated metadata such as file type and size. Additionally, implementing robust error handling and validation mechanisms to prevent data corruption or security vulnerabilities posed additional complexities.

For milestone 2, our priority will be to address these challenges by refining our backend infrastructure. This includes optimising our file upload processes, implementing enhanced error handling mechanisms, and ensuring seamless integration with MongoDB Atlas for efficient data storage and retrieval. By resolving these issues, we aim to achieve a more robust and scalable application framework that meets our functional requirements while maintaining high standards of performance and data security.

## Software Engineering Practices

Our project follows industry-standard practices such as:

- Git and GitHub form the backbone of our version control strategy. We use Git for tracking changes and GitHub for hosting repositories, facilitating seamless collaboration among team members. This setup allows us to manage code versions, track changes, and coordinate development efforts effectively.

- MongoDB Atlas serves as our database management platform, providing a scalable and reliable solution for storing and managing data. We leverage MongoDB's document-oriented structure to efficiently store and retrieve data, supporting our application's dynamic data requirements.

- We emphasize the importance of code reviews as a critical step in ensuring code quality and maintainability. Before merging code into the main branch, team members conduct thorough peer reviews. Code reviews help identify potential issues, ensure adherence to coding standards, and share knowledge among team members, ultimately improving overall code quality

- We abide to proper naming Conventions and Folder Organization. Maintaining consistent and descriptive naming conventions is essential for clarity and readability: Pages, Components, and Contexts: We adopt meaningful names for pages, components, and context providers to convey their purpose and functionality clearly. These entities are organized into dedicated folders within our project structure, promoting modular and maintainable code.

- Incorporating comprehensive comments and documentation within our codebase to enhance readability and facilitate communication: We use comments strategically to explain complex logic, clarify intent, and provide context for future modifications. Clear and concise comments help teammates understand the code's purpose and implementation details. In addition to inline comments, we maintain external documentation to outline project architecture, API references, and deployment procedures. Documentation serves as a reference for developers and stakeholders, ensuring transparency and ease of maintenance.

- Applying the KISS Principle. The "Keep It Simple, Stupid" (KISS) principle guides our approach to software design and development: We prioritize simplicity in our codebase, favoring straightforward solutions over complex ones. By minimizing unnecessary complexity and dependencies, we enhance code readability, maintainability, and scalability.
