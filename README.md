## Motivation and Aim

Studies show that the best way to improve active recall is through the use of flashcards and self-testing, but there aren't any good studying apps that create questions or flashcards for us, forcing us to make them manually. We want to help students like us learn concepts more quickly and easily, in a more engaging
manner.

This is our motivation for EchoNotes, a productivity app that streamlines the process of creating multiple-choice or fill-in-the-blank questions and flashcards to aid students in
applying studying techniques such as active recall and spaced repetition easily.


## Goals for milestone 1

<div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; color:black; background-color: lightgrey; margin: 10px 0;">
  In milestone 1, our goal was to have a functional frontend that allows us to store notes and a backend that stores the data. The techstack we used is MERN. We use React for our frontend and Express.js and Node.js for the backend with MongoDB Atlas as the choice of database. 
  
  However, we ran into problems while attempting to store PDFs in our backend which is a key problem we hope to address for milestone 2.

## Key Features (Milestone 1)

- Input PDF as your notes
- State the title and subject of your notes
- Notes stored will be reflected in your notes
- Delete notes as you wish

## Future features in milestone 2

- Operational backend to store data linked to frontend
- New pages added
  - Authentication (Landing) page: Users will be asked to authenticate using a simple email and password. Upon successful authentication, they will be taken to their own personalized home page
  - Notes page will be seperate from the home page, consists of all their notes sorted in users' chosen order
- Access the pdf from your notes page
- MCQ questions generated from PDF inserted. We intend to use the ChatGPT API to help us generate these question banks
- The app will be hosted for public access. We will gather target users' feedback for implementation in milestone 3

## Future features in milestone 3 (extended features)

- Introduce gamified elements, including points, achievements, and the virtual pet.
- UI and UX improved based on user feedback. 
- Bug fixes
- Establish a networking system for users to share their personal notes with selected friends
